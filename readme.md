This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for thermal conductivity observations. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

The Excel workbook indicates the content requested for information used to discover and retrieve data associated with thermal conductivity measurements. This version of template is focused on conductivity and diffusivity measurements made on single rock samples.

Services are currently deployed using the tagged 2.0 version of this information exchange.
